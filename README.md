# Parametric and Nonparametric Estimation in Statistics

In statistics, an estimation problem is considered **parametric** if the quantity of interest is a scalar or a vector, such as the parameters of a probability distribution. However, when the unknown quantity is a function that resides in a space so vast that it cannot be parameterized by a finite-dimensional vector (for example, the set of all continuous functions), it is referred to as a **nonparametric estimation problem**.

An example of a nonparametric problem is the estimation of the density of a continuous distribution when few or no assumptions are made about the form of the density. A well-known nonparametric estimator is the **histogram**, which is the focus of this project. Specifically, we will study the **consistency** and **quadratic risk** of the histogram and address the **model selection problem**, which involves determining the best choice of subintervals over which the histogram is computed.
